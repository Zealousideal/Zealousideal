## 👋 Hi, I'm Sinoy De

I build things at the intersection of **cybersecurity, and deep tech**.  
Currently focused on **defensive systems, threat intelligence, and security engineering**, with a soft spot for compilers, low-level tooling, and systems that actually *work* under pressure.

---

### 🧠 What I Work On
- 🔐 **Cybersecurity & Threat Analysis**  
  OSINT pipelines, heuristic scorers, anomaly detection, secure database frameworks  
- 🌐 **Security Engineering**  
  Network security, protocol analysis, IDS/IPS concepts, secure architectures  
- ⚙️ **Systems & Low-level Curiosity**  
  Lexers, interpreters, C-based tooling, understanding things from first principles  
- 🤖 **Deep Tech Exploration**  
  Quantum computing concepts, AGI safety, applied ML for security use-cases  

---

### 🛠 Tech Stack (Battle-tested, not buzzwords)
- **Languages:** Python, C, C++, Bash, SQL  
- **Security:** OSINT, Network Security, Web Security, Threat Modeling  
- **Databases:** MongoDB, SQL-based systems  
- **Tools:** Kali Linux, Git, Docker, Wireshark, Burp Suite  
- **Concepts:** Compilers, Protocols, Cryptography basics, Secure System Design  

---

### 📌 Current Focus
- Building **real-world security tooling**, not toy demos  
- Designing **scoring systems & detectors** that rely on *measurable signals*, not vibes  
- Learning **web application development** from a security-first perspective

### 🧭 Philosophy
I prefer **understanding over abstraction**,  
**signal over noise**,  
and **systems that fail loudly instead of silently**.

Security is not about paranoia — it’s about *clarity*.

### 📫 Reach Me
If you're building something serious in **security, research, or infrastructure**,  
or breaking things to understand them better — we’ll get along.
